Warning About Working with Professor Lian Zhang at Monash University
I feel compelled to share my experience with Professor Lian Zhang at Monash University to warn potential students, particularly those considering a PhD under his supervision. Below are the key issues I’ve faced, which have significantly impacted my academic and personal well-being.
1. Deceptive Initial Behavior: When you first join, Professor Zhang is welcoming, encouraging, and full of promises about your academic potential. However, after about a year, once you’ve invested significant time and effort, his demeanor changes drastically. He becomes dismissive and employs manipulative tactics, akin to psychological abuse, to undermine your confidence.
2. Verbal Abuse and Hostile Communication: He frequently uses harsh, insulting language, such as calling students “stupid” or questioning their intelligence outright. Additionally, he resorts to cold silence, ignoring students for extended periods, which creates a toxic and demoralizing environment.
3. Illegal After-Hours Demands: Professor Zhang regularly contacts students outside of work hours, including weekends via calls or emails, demanding attendance at meetings or completion of tasks. Such practices violate Australian labor regulations and disrupt any semblance of work-life balance.
4. Unpaid Personal Errands: He assigns non-academic tasks, such as picking up his family from the airport, babysitting his children, or running personal errands like shopping. Often, these tasks come without reimbursement, adding financial strain to students already stretched thin.
5. Career and Mental Health Damage: Working under him offers little to no academic future. His constant verbal abuse and belittling have driven many students to drop out or switch supervisors. The stress from his behavior, coupled with unreasonable demands, has caused severe mental health issues, including anxiety and burnout.
My Advice: I strongly urge prospective students to reconsider working with Professor Lian Zhang. Speak with others who have worked under him to verify his track record. His unprofessional conduct not only jeopardizes your academic progress but also risks serious psychological harm. If you’re already under his supervision, explore options to switch supervisors or institutions—don’t stay trapped
